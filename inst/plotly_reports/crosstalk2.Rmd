### Filters

```{r}
library(crosstalk)
# Notice the 'group = ' argument - this does the trick!
shared_df1 <- SharedData$new(df1, ~owner, group = "Choose owner")
shared_df2 <- SharedData$new(df2, ~owner, group = "Choose owner")

filter_select("owner", "Car owner:", shared_df1, ~owner)
# You don't need this second filter now
# filter_select("owner", "Car owner:", shared_df2, ~ owner)
```

### Plot1 with plotly

```{r}
plot_ly(shared_df1, x = ~id, y = ~hp, color = ~owner) %>%
  add_markers() %>%
  highlight("plotly_click")
```

### Plots with plotly

```{r}
plot_ly(shared_df2, x = ~owner, y = ~freq, color = ~car) %>%
  dplyr::group_by(owner) %>%
  add_bars()
```

### Dataframe 1

```{r}
DT::datatable(shared_df1)
```

### Dataframe 2
