### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
foo <- data.frame(foo = c("A", "B", "C"), fc = c(2, 3, -1), val = c(0.1, 0.01, 0.4))
shared_prot <- SharedData$new(foo, ~foo, group = "Choose protein")


x <- filter_select("foo", "Foo :", shared_prot, ~foo)
p <- plot_ly(shared_prot, x = ~fc, y = ~val, type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>% highlight("plotly_click") # %>% add_markers()
bscols(x, p)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
