# Introduction

This analysis tests if the __difference__ among the protein abundances measured in two groups is significantly non-zero. To perform the test the difference estimate is related to the within group variances.

To make the test as sensitive and specific as possible, to increase the power of the test, the methods used to measure protein abundances, and preprocess the data are optimized to minimize the biochemical and technical variance, and to remove biases. However, the downside is that the reported abundances and their differences can only be compared with their variances but often have no biological interpretation. 

The information which this report provides is if a protein is differential expressed between two groups given a  False Discovery Rate (FDR) threshold.


# Methods

The protein identification and quantification were performed using: 
`r if(!is.null(grp2$Software)){grp2$Software} else {"<Specify parameter grp2$Software>"}`. More details can be found in b-fabric.


We run a set of functions implemented in the R package _[prolfqua](https://github.com/wolski/prolfqua)_ [@prolfquaGithubIO] to filter and normalize the data, generate visualizations, and to compute differential expression analysis results which are e.g.: difference between groups, t-statistics, degrees of freedom, and  False Discovery Rates (FDR) for all proteins quantified. The improve the power of the tests the protein variances are moderated [@Smyth2004], i.e. the individual protein variances are updated using a variance prior estimated from all the proteins in the experiment.


# Results

```{r samples, eval=TRUE}

tab <- data.frame(table(grp2$RES$lfqData$factors()[[grp2$RES$lfqData$config$table$factor_keys_depth()]]))
colnames(tab) <- c("Group", "# samples")
knitr::kable(tab, caption = "Nr of samples in each group.")
```

Table \@ref(tab:samples) shows the number of samples in each group while Table \@ref(tab:annotation) shows the names of the files assigned to the group.

```{r annotation, eval=TRUE}
knitr::kable(grp2$RES$lfqData$factors(), caption = "LC-MS raw file annotation table. The content of the sampleName column is used as a short form to plot labels. The group to which a sample is assigned to is shown in the column group.")
```


## Protein identification

The protein matrix is filtered using the following threshold:

- Minimum number of peptides / protein: `r grp2$pop$nrPeptides`.
- The overall number of proteins in this experiment is: `r grp2$RES$Summary$totalNrOfProteins` 
- Total number without decoys sequences is `r grp2$RES$Summary$NrOfProteinsNoDecoys` 
- Percentage of contaminants : `r grp2$RES$Summary$percentOfContaminants` %
- Percentage of false positives (Decoy sequences) : `r grp2$RES$Summary$percentOfFalsePositives` %


```{r nrPerSample, fig.cap="Number of identified proteins across raw files.", fig.with=10, fig.height=7}
sum <- SEP$lfqdata_transformed$get_Summariser()
sum$plot_hierarchy_counts_sample()
```

### Protein abundance analysis



The density plot (Figure \@ref(fig:violinPlot)) displays the protein abundance distribution for all raw files of the data set. Mayor differences between raw files could be a hint that the individual protein abundance values are affected by technical biases. These biases might need to be corrected, in order to separate them from biological effects.

(ref:violinPlot) Protein abundance distribution. The dots represent the median log2-transformed abundance value per raw file. The overall density distribution is shown as a rotated kernel density plot.

```{r violinPlot, fig.cap="(ref:violinPlot)", fig.with=10, fig.height=7}
pl <- grp2$RES$lfqData$get_Plotter()
pl$intensity_distribution_density()
hm <- SEP$lfqdata_transformed$get_Plotter()$heatmap()
```


### Missing value analysis


Figure \@ref(fig:missingProtein) left panel, shows the number of proteins (y) axis with $0-N$ missing values (x - axis), while
the histogram on the right panel shows the distribution of the mean protein intensities of the group of samples, for all proteins with $0-N$ missing values.


(ref:missingProtein) Left panel - number of proteins with $n$ missing values (nrNA), Right panel - distribution of average intensity within group, of proteins with 1 to N missing values.


```{r missingProtein, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="(ref:missingProtein)", fig.height=5, fig.width=8}

pl <- grp2$RES$lfqData$get_Plotter()
p2 <- pl$missigness_histogram()

sr <- grp2$RES$lfqData$get_Summariser()
p1 <- sr$plot_missingness_per_group()

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:distributionRaw) shows the distributions of raw protein intensity values for each sample. Ideally the violins should look  similar, that is have the same shape and span the same intensity range.

(ref:distributionRaw) Violin plots for quantifiable protein intensities, The y-axis is $\log_{10}$ transformed.

```{r distributionRaw, fig.width=8, fig.height=5, fig.cap="(ref:distributionRaw)", eval= TRUE}
pl$intensity_distribution_violin() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Figure \@ref(fig:scaling) shows the $\log_2$ fold change of the average sample intensity versus the mean average intensity of all samples. The samples average intensity value should not deviate more than 5 times from the average of all samples (linear scale).

```{r scaling, dpi=300, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Average intensity in sample vs average intensity in all samples. red line - critical fold change.", eval= TRUE}
xb <- grp2$RES$lfqData$data |>
  dplyr::group_by(!!sym(grp2$RES$lfqData$config$table$sampleName)) |>
  dplyr::summarize(median = median(!!sym(grp2$RES$lfqData$config$table$get_response())))

bb <- xb$median
names(bb) <- xb$sampleName
par(mar = c(10, 6, 3, 6))
barplot(sort(abs(log2(bb))) - mean(log2(bb)),
  horiz = F, las = 2, main = "median", cex.names = 0.6, ylab = "sample avg. - total avg. (log2 intensities)", ylim = c(-log2(8), log2(8))
)
abline(h = c(-log2(5), log2(5)), col = 2)
x <- seq(-3, 3, by = 1)
axis(4, x, round(2^abs(x), digits = 1))
mtext("linear scale", side = 4, line = 2)
```


## Normalization

Figure \@ref(fig:normalized) shows the normalized values. Normalization is applied to remove systematic differences in protein abundance due to different sample concentrations, or different amount of sample loaded on column. Normalization is important, so that true differentially expressed proteins can be detected. 

```{r normalization, results = 'asis'}
if (grp2$pop$transform == "robscale") {
  cat(
    "To do this the z-score of the $\\log_2$ transformed intensities is computed.",
    "Because we need to estimate the protein fold-changes on the original scale, we have to multiply the $z$-score by the average standard deviation of all the $N$ samples in the experiment.",
    "After normalization all samples have an equal mean and variance and a similar distribution."
  )
} else if (grp2$pop$transform == "vsn") {
  cat("To do this the variance stabilizing normalization (vsn) was applied [@HuberVSN2002].")
} else if (grp2$pop$transform == "none") {
  cat("However, in some circumstances it is advisable not to normalize the data, e.g. in case of affinity purification experiments, or when the requirements of sufficient similarity among samples are not met.")
}
```


(ref:normalized) Violin plots of normalized protein intensity values (z-score)

```{r normalized,  fig.width=8, fig.height=5,dpi=300, fig.cap="(ref:normalized)", eval=TRUE}
pl <- grp2$RES$transformedlfqData$get_Plotter()
pl$intensity_distribution_violin() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

The left panel of Figure \@ref(fig:SDViolin), show the coefficients of variations (CV) for all proteins computed on not normalized data. The right panel of Figure \@ref(fig:SDViolin) shows the distributions of standard deviations (sd) for all proteins after transforming and scaling the data. The values for all samples and in each group is shown. To observe differences between groups the variation within a group should ideally be smaller than across all samples.


(ref:SDViolin) Left panel - Distribution of coefficient of variation (CV) within groups and in entire experiment (all), Right panel - Distribution of protein standard deviation (sd), after intensity transformation and scaling within groups and in entire experiment.

```{r SDViolin, fig.height=3, fig.width=7, fig.cap="(ref:SDViolin)", eval=TRUE}
stR <- grp2$RES$lfqData$get_Stats()
p1 <- stR$violin()

st <- grp2$RES$transformedlfqData$get_Stats()
p2 <- st$violin()
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE}
resR <- stR$stats_quantiles()
res <- st$stats_quantiles()

C <- dplyr::bind_rows(
  CV = resR$wide |> dplyr::filter(probs == 0.5),
  sd = res$wide |> dplyr::filter(probs == 0.5)
)
C <- C |> dplyr::mutate(what = c("CV", "sd"), .before = 1)

C$probs <- NULL
knitr::kable(C, caption = "Median (prob 0.5) of coefficient of variation (CV) and standard deviation (sd)")
```


## Clustering for Samples and Proteins

```{r generateHeatmaps, inlcude = FALSE}
pl <- grp2$RES$transformedlfqData$get_Plotter()
ph <- pl$heatmap()
phc <- pl$heatmap_cor()
nah <- pl$NA_heatmap()
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:correlation) we show how samples are clustering depending on the spearman correlation. Side colors on top of the heatmaps indicate the grouping of the samples.

```{r correlation, dpi=300, fig.height=5, fig.width=7, fig.cap="Heatmap showing the pairwise spearman correlations between samples.", eval=TRUE}
phc
```

Figure \@ref(fig:heatmapData) shows the protein intensities of the dataset; columns correspond to samples, while rows to proteins. The rows are z-transformed, i.e. each row has the same mean and standard deviation. 



```{r heatmapData, fig.width=7, fig.height=8, dpi=300, fig.cap="Heatmap of normalized data. Columns - samples, rows - proteins. The intensities of each protein are z-transformed.", eval=TRUE}
ph
```


Finally, in the heatmap figure \@ref(fig:heatmapNA), we show in black if a protein is missing in a sample. Some experiments switch off the expression of a group of proteins and this can sometimes spotted in this figure. The samples and proteins are clustered based on the missigness information using the Minkowski distance.


```{r heatmapNA, fig.width=7, fig.height=8, dpi=300, fig.cap="Heatmap of proteins containing missing values, white - present, black - basent.", eval=TRUE}
nah
```




# Two Group Comparison

The following analysis assumed that most of the proteins are not regulated (most differences between the two groups should be close to zero, and only a few proteins are differentially expressed. Figure \@ref(fig:densityOFFoldChanges), Top, shows the distribution of fold changes. Most of the fold changes should be close to zero, and also the median of all fold changes (red dashed line) should be close to zero (green line).

The statistical analysis is performed by fitting a linear model, which was specified using the __R__ function `lm`, and specified using the model formula:

`r grp2$RES$formula`,

where `<response variable> ~ <explanatory variables>`. 

The response variable is the protein abundance estimate. 

We can compute the differences among the groups

`r names(grp2$pop$Contrast)` = `r grp2$pop$Contrast`,

and test for differential expression using the coefficients of the linear model.


Based on the linear model coefficients, we estimate the difference between the groups (column _diff_) and the variance for each protein, which allows us to compute the t-statistic (column _statistic_). Furthermore, using the degrees of freedom (column _df_), we determine the p-value, i.e., the probability of the Type I error (Type I error - the error of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis). The null hypothesis is that proteins are not differentially expressed. The bottom panel in Figure \@ref(fig:densityOFFoldChanges) shows the distribution of the p-values for all the proteins. The distribution of most of the p-values should be uniform (not-regulation), with some higher bars on the left, that is some significant proteins (small p-values). 

If, for some of the proteins, there are no observations in one of the groups the group mean con not be estimated. Therefore, assuming that the observation are missing because the protein abundance is below the limit of detection, we substitute the unobserved group mean with the mean of $1\%$ smallest group averages of all the porteins. If the observations present in the other group allow us to estimate the variance of the measurement for that protein we compute the t-statistic, p-value and FDR.

However, results for proteins with a large number of missing observations should be assessed separately. Therefore, proteins for which we imputed the unobserved group mean we label with `Imputed_Mean`. Those with a sufficient number of observations are labelled with `Linear_Model_Moderated` (see Figure \@ref(fig:volcanoplot), and column _modelName_ in the Excel table containing the analysis results.).

When testing the differential expression of many proteins, the p-value does not control the type I-error. Therefore, based on the distribution of the p-values, we estimate the false discovery rates (FDR), i.e., the expected proportion of false discoveries in a list of proteins filtered by FDR, using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.


(ref:densityOFFoldChanges) Top : distribution of differences among groups. Bottom - histogram of p-values.


```{r densityOFFoldChanges, fig.width=8, fig.height=4, dpi=300, fig.cap = "(ref:densityOFFoldChanges)"}

cpl <- grp2$RES$contrMerged$get_Plotter(FCthreshold = grp2$pop$Diffthreshold, FDRthreshold = grp2$pop$FDRthreshold)
p1 <- cpl$histogram_diff()
p2 <- cpl$histogram()$p.value
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2)
```


Figure \@ref(fig:volcanoplot) plots the $-\log_{10}(FDR)$ against the difference in the two groups. Significant calls are made with FDR smaller than `r grp2$pop$FDRthreshold` (horizontal line) and differences greater than `r grp2$pop$Diffthreshold` (vertical lines). Figure \@ref(fig:MAPlot) shows the difference between the groups (y-axis) and the average intensity of the protein (x-axis), and, for instance can be used to identify abundant proteins with large differences.

(ref:volcanoplot) Volcano plot where the x-axis shows the difference among the groups and the y-axis the $-\log_10(FDR)$.

```

Table \@ref(tab:nrsignificant) summarizes the number of significant calls with FDR < `r grp2$pop$FDRthreshold` and difference > `r grp2$pop$Diffthreshold`, while \@ref(tab:top20table) lists the 20 proteins with the smallest FDR.

# Data Interpretation

For interpreting the results in the `.xlsx` file, the protein $IDs$ can be either sorted by `diff`, `t-statistic` or $sign(diff) \cdot$ FDR. Large positive or negative fold changes typically result in smaller p-values.

The protein IDs sorted by fold change or t-statistic can then be subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Alternatively, a subset filtered by FDR, e.g. for a threshold of $0.1$ or $0.25$, can be analysed using over-representation analysis (ORA). The web application WebGestalt (WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit) <http://www.webgestalt.org> implements both of these methods for the most popular organisms [@Wang2017]. The [DAVID Bioinformatics Resource](https://david.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) also enables you to run ORA analysis for a wide variety of organizms.

Overrepresentation analysis is performed on biological functional categories (e.g., biological processes of gene ontology annotations) or on biological pathways (e.g., KEGG or Wikipathways). Using such methods allows identifying functions or pathways for proteins in the submitted list. For the correct usage and interpretation of the results from such an analysis, it is essential to specify the background proteome. The background proteome is the list of all proteins identified in your experiment.


A further resource to analyze the results is the STRING database <https://string-db.org> [@Szklarczyk2017]. It reports known and predicted interactions for proteins in the submit   ted list.


The FGCZ can support you, with the interpretation of your quantitative proteomics data or with a more customized analysis. Further visualization of the data, targeted to your audience, e.g., receiver operator curves (ROC) or MA-plots, can be generated. You can reach the proteome-bioinformatics team at <protinf@fgcz.uzh.ch>.


# Disclaimer


The obtained results should be validated orthogonal as well (e.g. with Western blots). The Functional Genomics Center Zurich does not provide any kind of guarantee for the validity of the results.

# Glossary

- groups - different treatments, genotypes etc.
- diff - it is the difference between the two groups. This difference in some cases can be interpreted as log2 FC, e.g. in case of label free quantification, and when the data is log2 transformed and the scaling preserve the variance. In other cases, e.g. TMT where ratio compression can be observed or when using other data transformations, the interpretation is not possible.
- FDR - false discovery rate
- p-value - probability of type I error.
