Description: The prolfqua package integrates essential steps
    of the mass spectrometry based label free quantification data
    analysis workflow: quality control, data normalization, protein aggregation,
    modeling, hypothesis testing and sample size estimation.
    We use prolfqua to : develop highly customizable, visually appealing,
    and interactive data analysis reports in pdf or HTML format;
    to visualize and model simple experimental designs
    with a single explanatory variable and complex experiments with multiple factors;
    to benchmark data acquisition,
    data preprocessing or data modeling methods.
    We developed and improved the package by applying the "Eating your own dog food" principle, making it easy to use.
